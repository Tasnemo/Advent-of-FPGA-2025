## Advent of FPGA 2025

This repo is me working through **Advent of FPGA 2025**, whichever ones come to me first.

I plan to solve the problem in multiple languages like **Python** to model, **VHDL** (my first RTL language), and **HardCaml** (Really just testing out what I'm doing)


I’m testing everything on a **Basys 3** that I borrowed from **NYU’s ECE department**.


## How I organized it

I'll put the days and then have folders for each implementation that I make, sometimes there will be two of the same language if i felt that my first solution wasn't nice enough
